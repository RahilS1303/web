	<img src="images\inkscape.jpg" alt="inkscape art by Rahil" style="height: 120px; width:360px; padding-left: 4px;">
	<p>Using inkscape i have created a art that is to remble a nights sky in a dark forest thats uplifted with light through the moons shine, this is ofcourse just to act as a demonstration of the tool and the power the program posses.</p>
    <p>the follwoing are some of the things i have done in digital technology:
	<li>inkscape graphic designing</li>
	 <li>blender rendering and animations</li>
	 <li>html and css coding </li></p>
    <p>Digitsl Technology for me is a great subject as it provides basic computing skills and also allows us to experiment with what the current generation of graphic, animation and coding has to offer to young blokes like myself. </p>
